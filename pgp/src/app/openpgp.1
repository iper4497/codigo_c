.Sh NAME
openpgp
.Nd Perform basic OpenPGP operations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm openpgp --encrypt --userid='Foo <foo@example.org>' --file=data.txt
.Pp
.Nm openpgp --list-keys --keyring=/path/to/keyring.gpg
.Pp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can perform basic OpenPGP operatings in compliance with RFC 4880.
.Pp
You must supply one command, and any number of options.
.Pp
.Sh COMMANDS
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--list-keys\fP list all public keys and associated user ids found
in \fIkeyring\fP.
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--list-packets\fP list all OpenPGP packets found in \fIfile\fP.
Use \fB--armour\fP if \fIfile\fP is ASCII-armored.
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--encrypt\fP encrypt the specified \fIfile\fP. The encrypted data
will be output to \fIfile\fP.gpg or \fIfile\fP.asc (depending on the
presence of \fI--armour\fP).
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--decrypt\fP decrypt the specified \fIfile\fP.  Specify
\fB--armour\fP if \fBfile\fP is ASCII-armored.  If \fIfile\fP is in
"foo.asc" or "foo.gpg", the output will be placed in "foo".  Otherwise,
the output will be placed in \fIfile\fP.decrypted.  \fBopenpgp\fP may
prompt for a passphrase on the console if needed for access to the
private key material stored in \fIkeyring\fP/secring.gpg.
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--sign\fP sign the specified \fIfile\fP and store output in
\fIfile\fP.gpg or \fIfile\fP.asc (depending on presence of
\fB--armour\fP)
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--clearsign\fP sign the specified \fIfile\fP and create
human-readable clearsigned output in \fIfile\fP.asc
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--verify\fP ensure that specified \fIfile\fP is properly signed.
Specify \fB--armour\fP if \fIfile\fP is ASCII-armored.
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--generate-key\fP create an RSA primary key of bit length
\fInumbits\fP with User ID \fIuserid\fP and store it in \fIhomedir\fP.
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--export-key\fP export the first key with User ID \fIuserid\fP from
\fIkeyring\fP.  This emits the key in ASCII-armored form to standard
output.
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--import-key\fP imports the OpenPGP-formatted RSA key in \fIfile\fP
and store it in \fIhomedir\fP.  Specify \fB--armour\fP if the key is
ASCII-armored.
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--keyring=\fP\fIkeyring\fP selects a keyring to scan for
\fB--list-keys\fP.
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--userid=\fP\fIuserid\fP selects which userid to use for signatures,
to target for encryption, or for key generation.
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--file=\fP\fIfilename\fP selects the file to use for encryption or
decryption.
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--numbits=\fP\fInumbits\fP determines the size of newly-generated
RSA keys.
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--armour\fP indicates whether to produce or consume ASCII-armored
OpenPGP material.  Lack of this flag usually indicates no ASCII armor.
.Pp
.ti 2
\fB--homedir=\fP\fIhomedir\fP specifies where to find keyrings for
encryption and decryption.  Secret key material is looked for in
\fIhomedir\fP/secring.gpg, and public key material is looked for in
\fIhomedir\fP/pubring.gpg.  If not specified, \fIhomedir\fP defaults
to ~/.gnupg .
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm openpgp --list-keys --keyring=$(pwd)/my-keyring.gpg
.Pp
.Nm openpgp --decrypt --file=blah.gpg
.Sh BUGS
\fB--verify\fP does not seem to work with clearsigs.
.Pp
It does not appear possible to both sign and encrypt in the same step.
.Pp
\fB--keyring\fP seems to need an absolute path to the keyring file.
.Pp
\fB--list-keys\fP does not actually validate the self-signatures of
any attached user IDs.
.Pp
\fB--encrypt\fP will encrypt to keys not specifically marked for
encryption.
.Pp
\fB--export-key\fP does not seem to emit the self-signature for keys.
.Pp
It is not possible to \fB--export-key\fP without ASCII armor.
